# maplib
Dataframe-based interactive knowledge graph construction, validation and enrichment using stOTTR templates and SPARQL. The library is especially suitable for problems that arise when building industrial knowledge graphs. The library is a Rust-based implementation of [stOTTR](https://dev.spec.ottr.xyz/stOTTR/). Implemented with [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) in Rust using [Pola.rs](https://www.pola.rs/), with a Python wrapper.

There is an associated paper [1] that can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10106242).

## Mapping
We can easily map DataFrames to RDF-graphs using the Python library. Below is a reproduction of the example in the paper [1]. Assume that we have a DataFrame given by: 

```python
ex = "https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/example#"
co = "https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/countries#"
pi = "https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza#"
ing = "https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza/ingredients#"

import polars as pl
df = pl.DataFrame({"p":[pi + "Hawaiian", pi + "Grandiosa"],
                   "c":[co + "CAN", co + "NOR"],
                   "is": [[ing + "Pineapple", ing + "Ham"],
                          [ing + "Pepper", ing + "Meat"]]})
df
```
That is, our DataFrame is:

| p                             | c                                  | is                                                   |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| str                           | str                                | list[str]                                            |
| "https://.../pizza#Hawaiian"  | "https://.../maplib/countries#CAN" | [".../ingredients#Pineapple", ".../ingredients#Ham"] |
| "https://.../pizza#Grandiosa" | "https://.../maplib/countries#NOR" | [".../ingredients#Pepper", ".../ingredients#Meat"]   |

Then we can define a stOTTR template, and create our knowledge graph by expanding this template with our DataFrame as input:
```python
from maplib import Mapping
pl.Config.set_fmt_str_lengths(150)

doc = """
@prefix pizza:<https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza#>.
@prefix xsd:<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>.
@prefix ex:<https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza#>.

ex:Pizza[?p, xsd:anyURI ?c, List<xsd:anyURI> ?is] :: {
ottr:Triple(?p, a, pizza:Pizza),
ottr:Triple(?p, pizza:fromCountry, ?c),
cross | ottr:Triple(?p, pizza:hasIngredient, ++?is)
}.
"""

m = Mapping([doc])
m.expand("ex:Pizza", df)
```

We can immediately query the mapped knowledge graph:

```python
m.query("""
PREFIX pizza:<https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza#>
SELECT ?p ?i WHERE {
?p a pizza:Pizza .
?p pizza:hasIngredient ?i .
}
""")
```

The query gives the following result (a DataFrame):

| p                             | i                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| str                           | str                                 |
| "https://.../pizza#Grandiosa" | "https://.../ingredients#Meat"      |
| "https://.../pizza#Grandiosa" | "https://.../ingredients#Pepper"    |
| "https://.../pizza#Hawaiian"  | "https://.../ingredients#Pineapple" |
| "https://.../pizza#Hawaiian"  | "https://.../ingredients#Ham"       |

Next, we are able to perform a construct query, which creates new triples but does not insert them. 

```python
hpizzas = """
PREFIX pizza:<https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza#>
PREFIX ing:<https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza/ingredients#>
CONSTRUCT { ?p a pizza:UnorthodoxPizza } 
WHERE {
    ?p a pizza:Pizza .
    ?p pizza:hasIngredient ing:Pineapple .
}"""
res = m.query(hpizzas)
res[0]
```

The resulting triples are given below:

| subject                      | verb                               | object                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| str                          | str                                | str                                 |
| "https://.../pizza#Hawaiian" | "http://.../22-rdf-syntax-ns#type" | "https://.../pizza#UnorthodoxPizza" |

If we are happy with the output of this construct-query, we can insert it in the mapping state. Afterwards we check that the triple is added with a query.

```python
m.insert(hpizzas)
m.query("""
PREFIX pizza:<https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza#>

SELECT ?p WHERE {
?p a pizza:UnorthodoxPizza
}
""")
```

Indeed, we have added the triple: 

|p|
|-|
|str|
|"https://github.com/DataTreehouse/maplib/pizza#Hawaiian"|
